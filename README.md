## Introduction

Churn prediction is a common problem in the financial industry, where the goal is to identify customers who are likely to churn or leave a service. In this project, we develop machine learning models to predict customer churn in a FinTech company.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are as follows:
- Explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior.
- Preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical features.
- Build and compare several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Neural Network (ANN), and an Ensemble (VotingClassifier).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models' performance.
- Evaluate the models using relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Save the best models for future use.
